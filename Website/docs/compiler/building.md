# Building Programs

`hcp65build` compiles and links HCP65 programs from the command line, the same way the HCP65
IDE does.  It builds in one of two ways:

- **From a solution.**  A Visual Studio `.sln` or `.vcxproj` says which files and include
  directories each project has, and an `.hcp65build` file beside it says how to build them for
  the HCP65.  The same solution still builds natively in Visual Studio.
- **From a plain command line.**  The sources, include directories and output are all given as
  arguments, with no solution.

It is built with the HCP65 IDE (`HCP65-IDE/HCP65Build`).  On Linux it's `hcp65build`; on Windows
`hcp65build.exe`.

## Building a solution

```text
hcp65build <file.sln | file.vcxproj | file.hcp65build | file.hcp65workspace> [options]
```

An `.hcp65build` file builds the `.sln` of the same name beside it, or the `.vcxproj` if there is
no solution.

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| <code>-config "Release&#124;W65C816"</code> | The configuration to build, from the `.hcp65build` file.  Default: the workspace's last one, else the first HCP65 one. |
| `-startup <project>` | The project whose program is built.  Default: the one the workspace names, else the first. |
| `-card` | Also copy each executable and module onto the configuration's SD card image (`Card`, `CardPath`). |
| `-show-plain <file>` | Write the build as a [plain command line](#a-plain-command-line) instead of building.  `hcp65build @<file>` then builds the same thing. |

The program goes in `Output/<toolchain>/<configuration>` and the listings in `Listing/`, beside
the solution.  For example, from `HCP65/ModPlay`:

```text
hcp65build HCP65ModPlay.hcp65build -config "Release|W65C816"
```

### The .hcp65build file

An `.hcp65build` file is XML: a list of configurations, each naming a toolchain, the Visual Studio
configuration whose files and settings it builds, and what to link.  This is
`HCP65/ModPlay/HCP65ModPlay.hcp65build`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<BuildConfigurations>
	<Configuration Name="Release|W65C816" Toolchain="W65C816" Solution="Release|Win32"
	               BreakpointSpace="User" Card="..\HCP65-Emulator\TestHCP65Lib\TestHCP65Lib\Output\SDCard.img"
	               CardPath="\modplay.exe">
		<Executable File="modplay.exe" Entry="UserStart" Limit="0x200000">
			<Symbol Name="UserHeapSize" Value="0x180000"/>
		</Executable>
		<Load File="..\Kernal\Output\W65C816\Release\Kernal.rom" Address="0x0"/>
	</Configuration>
</BuildConfigurations>
```

| Attribute of `Configuration` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Name` | What the configuration is chosen by: its configuration and platform either side of a <code>&#124;</code>. |
| `Toolchain` | `W65C816` or `65C64`.  A configuration can also name a native toolchain (MSVC or GCC), which the IDE uses to build for the host. |
| `Solution` | The Visual Studio configuration whose projects, files, include directories and defines are built (<code>Debug&#124;Win32</code>). |
| `NoFloats="true"` | Floating point is an error.  The kernal is built this way. |
| `MathTables="false"` | Build to run without the maths tables in memory: the multiplies use the table-free runtime.  For the kernal, its drivers and the operating system, which run before the tables are loaded. |
| `PreferSize="true"` | Prefer smaller code to faster where the compiler has the choice. |
| `BreakpointSpace` | The emulator's address space (`Kernel` or `User`) that the IDE's breakpoints go in. |
| `Card`, `CardPath` | An SD card image, and the path on its FAT volume, that `-card` and the IDE's debugger copy the program to. |

A configuration has at most one of these, which says what the build writes.  Without one the
units are only compiled.

| Element | Writes |
|---|---|
| `<Executable File Entry Limit>` | A program the HCP65 kernal loads and runs.  `<Symbol Name Value/>` children are absolute symbols the loader or the program reads, such as `UserHeapSize`. |
| `<Image File Size Fill Limit Load>` | A file of a fixed size, such as a ROM.  `<Region Start End Offset/>` children say where the code linked at each range of addresses goes in the file; unused bytes are `Fill`. |
| `<Module File Entry Limit>` | A relocatable driver the kernal can load anywhere in a bank. |

`Limit` is the highest address the linker may place anything at.  `<Load File Address/>` is a
file the IDE's debugger loads into the emulator first: a kernal ROM for a program to run on.
Numbers are decimal or `0x` hexadecimal, and paths are relative to the `.hcp65build` file.

[Linker and Outputs](linker.md) describes the three kinds of file.

## A plain command line

```text
hcp65build -program <name> [-dir <dir>] [-D <define>]... <source>... [-lib <name> ...]... [options]
```

Each `-program` or `-lib` starts a project, and the sources after it are its units.  A library's
units are linked only when something uses them.  Sources can be `.cpp` or `.asm`.

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-program <name>`, `-lib <name>` | Start a project.  Its sources follow. |
| `-dir <dir>` | The project's directory.  Its sources are relative to it (default: the current directory). |
| `-D <name>[=<value>]` | A define for the project's units. |
| `-I <dir>`, `-I+ <dir>` | An include directory; `-I+` lists all the headers in its sub directories when the build starts.  Before the first `-program` or `-lib` it's every unit's; after, that project's. |
| <code>-target W65C816&#124;65C64</code> | The processor (default `W65C816`). |
| `-nofloats` | Floating point is an error. |
| `-no-mathtables` | Build without the maths tables. |
| `-prefer-size` | Prefer smaller code to faster. |
| `-exe <file> -entry <symbol> [-limit <n>] [-symbol <name>=<n>]...` | Link an executable. |
| `-image <file> -size <n> [-fill <n>] [-limit <n>] [-load <n>] -region <start>,<end>,<offset>...` | Link an image. |
| `-module <file> -entry <symbol> [-limit <n>]` | Link a module (a driver). |
| `-o <dir>`, `-listings <dir>` | Where the program and the listings go (default: `Output/<target>/Plain` and `Listing/<target>/Plain`). |

Options for both ways of building:

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-libc65 <directory>` | Libc65.  Default: the first `HCP65/Libraries/Libc65` found going up from the tool or the file. |
| `-quiet` | Leave out the progress lines. |
| `@<file>` | Read arguments from a file, one a line.  Lines starting with `#` are comments, and a file can name other `@` files. |
| `-help` | List the options. |

Numbers are decimal, `0x` or `$` hexadecimal.  The exit code is 0 when the build succeeded, 1
when it failed and 2 for a bad command line or file.

### An example

A program the HCP65 kernal runs needs UserLib's start up, `UserStart.asm`, and its kernal call
stubs.  Libc65's units include BaseLib's headers, so `CommonLibraries/Libraries` must be an
include directory.  From a directory beside `HCP65` and `CommonLibraries`:

```text
hcp65build -program Hello -I+ CommonLibraries/Libraries -I+ HCP65/Libraries/UserLib
           Hello.cpp HCP65/Libraries/UserLib/UserStart.asm HCP65/Libraries/UserLib/UserCalls.asm
           -exe hello.exe -entry UserStart -limit 0x200000 -symbol UserHeapSize=0x20000
```

with `Hello.cpp` a `printf("Hello\n")` in `main`, writes

```text
Process (Hello.cpp)
Process (ctype.cpp)
...
Wrote 65788 bytes to Output/W65C816/Plain/hello.exe.
Wrote its line table to Output/W65C816/Plain/hello.exe.lines.
Plain|W65C816 build succeeded.
```

The `Process (...)` lines are each unit being preprocessed, Libc65's among them.  The easiest
way to get a working command line for a real program is to let `-show-plain` write it from a
solution.

Sources can be relative to the project's `-dir` or full paths.  An include directory given with
`-I` finds headers in its sub directories by their path (`#include "BaseLib/Chars.h"`), as a C++
compiler's does; `-I+` lists every header below it when the build starts.  An executable's or
module's entry is always kept, even when nothing in the program calls it.

Without `-exe`, `-image` or `-module` the units are compiled but not linked, which is a quick way
to see what the compiler writes for a file:

```text
hcp65build -program Sum Sum.cpp -target 65C64 -listings Listing
```

writes `Listing/Sum.lst`.  [Listings, Profiling and Testing](testing.md#listings) shows one.

## From C++

`hcp65build` and the IDE drive `CCPP65Builder`, which any program can use: the test suites do.

```cpp
CCPP65Builder	cBuilder;

cBuilder.Init();
cBuilder.SetTarget(CPPT_W65C816);				//Before anything is added.
cBuilder.AddIncludeDirectory(szLibc65, false, true);
cBuilder.AddIncludeDirectory(szCommonLibraries, true, false);
cBuilder.AddUnit("Hello", szDirectory, "Hello.cpp");
cBuilder.AddLibc65(szLibc65);					//Libc65 and the runtime, linked as libraries.
cBuilder.SetRemoveUnused(true);
...
cBuilder.Kill();
```

| Method | Does |
|---|---|
| `SetTarget` | The processor.  It picks the predefined macros, the back end, the assembler and the linker's bank size. |
| `GetOptions` | The `CCPPCompileOptions`: speed or size, the optimiser, inlining, register arguments, the assembly units. |
| `AddUnit`, `AddVisualStudioProject`, `AddProjectSources` | The units to compile.  `.asm` units are assembled. |
| `AddLibc65`, `AddRuntime`, `AddMathTables` | Libc65's units, the W65C816 runtime, and the maths tables, as libraries. |
| `SetNoFloats`, `SetMathTables`, `SetLimit`, `SetStubMissing`, `SetRemoveUnused` | As the options above. |
| `SetListingDirectory`, `SetLineTable` | Listings, and the line table a debugger reads. |
| `SetJobs`, `SetHeaderCache`, `SetLazyHeaders` | Compile units on several threads; share preprocessed headers between units; parse only the header code a unit uses. |
| `SetFrameProfile` | A measured profile for the W65C816's aligned frames (see [W65C816 Code](w65c816.md#frames)). |
| `GetStatistics` | What the compile counted and timed. |
